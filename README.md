# Wombats

Wombats was the final project required to complete my database course.

Unfortunately I was unable to find the syllobus for this project, but I will try to explain the project.

The final project required me to create a MySQL database in which we would be storing information in reguards to racing wombats.
If you are unfamiliar with wombats, please check out this wikipedia link on wombats.

Wombats: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wombat

We were required to create the wombats database by trying to seperate the information reguarding the wombats using normalization.
I tried as much as possible to properly separate information reguarding wombat's owners, racing information, Nom de Course (Wombat's racing names), champion wombats, and wombats themselves into seperate tables within the database.

Four seperate files were required for the project:

Create_Wombat_Tables_And_Trigger_Queries.sql : This file contains all the creations of the tables, triggers, and proper displacement of the information of wombats.

Create_Wombat_Tables_And_Trigger_Queries.sql: This file tested the triggers of the tables.

Question_Queries.sql: This file contained queries in which I was to answer questions after creating my Wombats database.

E-RDiagram.pdf: Contains a E-R diagram of the Wombats database.
